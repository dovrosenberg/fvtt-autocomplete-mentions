Many usability improvements, thanks to Sylvercode
- Use selected text as initial search input
  - Selected text will also be preserved as a manual label
- Use the current filter as the default text when creating a new item
- Easy ability to reference the current journal (when editing from inside a journal)
- Ability to search compendia (and a setting to indicate which ones)
- Ability to create a page in a journal
- When creating a new document of the same type as the one being edited, put it in the same folder

Also a bug fix (ditto on the credit):
- Give focus back to the editor when closing the search box
