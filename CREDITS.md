## Translators

| Language                  | Translator(s)                                                               |

|                           |                                                                             |
|                           |                                                                             |

Would love to have help providing translations to other languages

### Inspiration
The original structure (and UI) of this module was inspired by/copied from the [Autocomplete Inline Properties module](https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/FVTT-Autocomplete-Inline-Properties) by ghost.  [Tip](https://ko-fi.com/ghostfvtt) them - they do great work on all sorts of Foundry modules.

 While not much is left from there, [here's](https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/FVTT-Autocomplete-Inline-Properties/blob/main/LICENSE) the license notice just for completeness.
